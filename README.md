# GitHub and collaboration with code 

The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding â€” learning to collaborate within a group on a common set of data.

-[ ] organization site or Project site model

-[ ] Use GitHub Pages 

-[ ] Start creating content (One page per person)
You can create a site for our course; an informational site for your team; a pretend site for the (non-existent) technical project you 
created earlier; or even something completely unrelated to our class topic (like a site about a band or TV show, or 
collaboratively-written fiction).

-[ ] resolve conflicts that arise when multiple people make conflicting changes to the same file; therefore, a requirement is that each content unit contain edits by at least two members of the team

- Pull requests
- Conversation mechanism
- Projects
- Issues?
- Actions?

Gaded on

-[ ] how much you individually contributed to the project (as evidenced by the Github records)
-[ ] how broadly your team used the version control features of git and the collaboration features available in Github and Slack
-[ ] At least one pull request per content unit
